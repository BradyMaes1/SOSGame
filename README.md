# SOSGame

Summary:
This project aims to create a fully function SOS game in Java accompanied by a GUI. There will be two game modes: simple and general. A "simple" game will end as soon as a user creates an SOS. A "general" game will end only once the board is full or no new SOSs can possibly be created. At the end of a general game, the number of SOSs formed by each player is tallied and the winner is the player with the most SOSs. There will be a two-player "human versus human" option as well as a single-player "human versus machine" mode where a player may play against the computer on varying difficulties. Players will also be given the option to select a board size within certain bounds. The program is replayable and players may select to play a new game once they have completed their prior game.

|Design Choices| |
|--------------------------------------|------|
| Object-oriented programming language | Java |
| GUI library (strongly encouraged)    | JavaFX (Subject to change if I decide it does not meet my needs) |
| IDE (Integrated Development Environment) | IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition |
| xUnit framework (e.g., JUnit for Java) | JUnit version 5 (I also might use Mockito for testing small game functionalities). In the case of JUnit 5 with IntelliJ Community Edition, I will be using Maven. |
| Programming style guide (must read it carefully) | Google Java Style Guide (I am a big fan of Camel and Pascal casing as well as limiting characters on each line). <br> *Also worth noting that IntelliJ, like many IDEs, has the option to be configured to a specific style guide. This can be done for my project with the Google Java Format Plugin.* |
| Project hosting site | GitHub (github.com) |
| Other decisions if applicable | I make some other decisions found in my brainstorming section below. |
