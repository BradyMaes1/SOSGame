# SOSGame

| Object-oriented programming language | Java |
|--------------------------------------|------|
| GUI library (strongly encouraged)    | JavaFX (Subject to change if I decide it does not meet my needs) |
| IDE (Integrated Development Environment) | IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition |
| xUnit framework (e.g., JUnit for Java) | JUnit version 5 (I also might use Mockito for testing small game functionalities). In the case of JUnit 5 with IntelliJ Community Edition, I will be using Maven. |
| Programming style guide (must read it carefully) | Google Java Style Guide (I am a big fan of Camel and Pascal casing as well as limiting characters on each line). <br> *Also worth noting that IntelliJ, like many IDEs, has the option to be configured to a specific style guide. This can be done for my project with the Google Java Format Plugin.* |
| Project hosting site | GitHub (github.com) |
| Other decisions if applicable | I make some other decisions found in my brainstorming section below. |
